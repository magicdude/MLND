    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A) Random Forest\n",
    "    - Banking: for fraud detection [see e.g. https://www.kaggle.com/abhikolte/fraud-detection-using-ubsmote-and-random-forest]. Medicine:disease identification [see e.g. Kasbohm et al., J Breath Res. 2017 Nov 1;11(4):047105]. Stock market: prediction of stock behaviour [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00003.pdf]. E-Commerce: product recommendation [Ajesh et al. in ICACCI (2016)];\n",
    "    - Pros: works well with many input variables (i.e. features), scaling and normalization can be in principle omitted, good at dealing with multiple features that might be correlated;\n",
    "    - Cons: visually difficult to interprete, overfitting in case of noisy data, hyperparamters need good tuning for high quality of the model; \n",
    "    - the data has lots of features and it is not obvious which features might highly correlate with each other.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "B) SVM \n",
    "    - Medical imaging: tumor detection [Sweilam et al., Eg. Informatics J. 11, 81-92 (2010)]. Finance: time series prediction and financial analysis [Okasha, Int. J. Stat. Appl., 4, 28-39 (2014)], page ranking in internet search engines [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_SVM];\n",
    "    - Pros: due to the kernel trick can be used for the non-linearly separable data in the original feature space, works well in high dimensional spaces, works well when the the number of dimensions is larger than the number of data points (memory efficient), flexibility due to the possibility of using the variety of diffent kernel funcions (standard and custom), robust agains outliers;\n",
    "    - Cons: poor performance when the number of features is larger than the number of data points, no probability estimate;\n",
    "    - many features + it may be the case that the data is not linearly separable; \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "C) Logistic Regression\n",
    "    - Image recognition: image categorization [Nidhin Prabhakar et al., Proc. Comp. Sc., 46, 1817-1826 (2015)], medicine: prognosis of myocardial infarction [Vaz et al. Ind. J. Comm. Med., 34,  371–372 (2009)]\n",
    "    - Pros: can deal with non-linear boundaries (I mean here that one can use polynomials of higher orders in order to describe the non-linear feature dependence of the label variable, and subsequently use it in the sigmoid function. Currently sklearn does not provide an opportunity to use polynomials of higher orders for the logistic regression out-of-the-box, therefore one can use e.g. PolynomialFeatures in order to tranform the original feature matrix and then use it for the standard LogisticRegression classifier provided by sklearn. Already at my first submission I have carried out this procedure in order to reach the F-score of 0.7103 on the test set as one can see in the end of this notebook). Additionally logistic regression is very efficient and has usually low variance\n",
    "    - Cons: can't predict continuous outcomes, very sensitive to the usage of non-independent variables (which can easily spoil the prediction power), prone to sampling bias\n",
    "    - the data we have is probably non-linearly separable, relatively large size of the data set, at least as for my laptop:)"

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",

    "**Answer: ** The logistic regression appears to be supperior compared to the other two models in the case of our data, because when trained on the full training set its test F-score outperforms those of the random forest and SVC classifiers. SVC tends to yield the F-score that is very close to the one for the logistic regression model, but the computational time of the SVC method is just uncomparably larger than that of the logistic model. Finally, by looking at the F-score computed on the training data we see that the random forest model has the highest score, but this model has the lowest score on the test set meaning it overfits. Whereas the logistic model does not suffer from this problem, or at least overfits lesser compared to the other two models. Based on the above arguments I would strongly recommend to CharityML to use the logistic regression classification for the current problem."

    "**Answer: ** Logistic regression allows to predict the probability of a person earning 50K or more per year based on the features provided in the above data set. Roughly speaking the cost function in this case equals to the negative of the Maximum Likelihood. It is then minimized in order to get the model parameters for each feature. In simplier terms this means that weights with which features impact the final result are chosen such that the likelihood of the respective outcome is maximal. For a binary classification problem one then agrees upon a probability threshold, say 0.5, starting from which a person will be classified as the one who earns >=50K per year."

    "**Answer:** In order to in increase the statistical significance of analysis I have set n_estimators = 10000. As the result the feature importance yields three features (hours-per-week,capital-gain and education) that I have also suggested above and two different fatures, marital-status_civ-spouse and age, as opposed to native-coutry and capital-loss, which I proposed. Probably capital-loss is irrelevant if income is the netto income (i.e. not taking into account the losses). Futher, it seems to me that the native-country does not have a high impact on the overall prediction because, most of the data records in the data set belong to the US-based persons. Concequently splitting based on the coutry would not produce much of information gain. With this regard I agree that the age of a person might be crucial for the prediction whether or not the person earns >=50K, since a person has pretty good chances to earn 50K or more if this person is just above a typical age when one gets a first job or had worked a couple of years after the graduation (depending on the industry sector). I find it rather difficult to explain why a marital status may have such a big impact on the income. Perhaps it may have something to do with tax waiver or other social privileges for civ-spouses in the USA."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:** The accuracy score and F-score estimated based on the reduced features are slightly lower (approx. by 2% and 4%, respectively) than the ones from the original features. If the time would be a decisive critirea, I would use the reduced feature set because the trade-off in the quality of performance scores and computational time seems to be well justified."

In order to get grasp on the P-values I use the logistic regression as implemented in the module statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model."
